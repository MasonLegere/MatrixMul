# Row-wise Parallel Matrix Multiplication

This program implements row-wise parallel multiplication where the user specifies the number of threads that should be created. While matrices can be arbitrary in size, their entries are randomly selected values in (0,1). Once specifing a set of thread values the program will time each respective multiplcation and plot the final results together.
